I created this project for my upcoming interview with two distinguished solution engineers from Open AI. Further information regarding what drove the creation of this project is here: context\project_info.md

The context regarding the interview itself is below. There will be a lot of focus on the technical aspects of this project, while both interviewers will be roleplaying a CTO and Head of Innovation, in real life they are both senior solution engineers based in san fransico.

Your task is to help me understand this project back to front, I need to know every possible technical angle they may ask about. I would also like a surgical list of updates that could be made to this code project that would show that I have what it takes to join Open AI. This could be things such as token counts, error handling, model routing etc. Create all of this into an .md file in this directory and also a mermain diagram to show the flow of components, functions and high level architecture of this project.

In a seperate .md, I also want deep explinations, exploration and easy to follow talking points regarding why we used the models we used in this project for chat, text to speech, image recognition etc. and why we didn't use the latest and greates models (GPT 5.2, realtime voice etc.). I want tables showing the trade offs and comparisons against these models for these use cases across cost, latency, tokens, rate limits and anything else. I Want you to only use Open AI documentation to make this informed table and talking points found here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models and https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction. If you find that we are using an inferior model across all of those cateogories (cost, tokens, latency, rate limit etc.) then please point this out. I want you to also investigate questions regarding data sovreignty, does Open AI have any models that are onshore/locally deployed in Australia that would help regulated customers use these API's in country boundries? I know Azure has some regional deployments of Open AI but do your own research.

Focus Areas
Presentation of
Solution and Demo
(45 minutes)
This section is a continuation of your completed project.
You will present your live demo to members of the Solutions Engineering
leadership team who will play the roles of Head of Innovation and CTO.
There will be 45-minutes allotted for this portion. Please plan for:
● 20 minute presentation and demo,
● 10 minutes of questions throughout, or at the end whilst still in
role-play mode
● The remainder of the time will be for experiential based questions
from the team.
What to expect:
● These are mainly situational based questions and we heavily assess
on clear and concise communication, structured thinking, and
executive presence
● Most successful candidates have adopted the STAR method of
structured interviewing
● Technical expertise – know your solution inside and out. Have the
ability to explain why your approach is technically sound and how it
solves the customer’s problem. Prepare to answer in-depth technical
questions.
● Business expertise – connect your technical solution to business
goals, demonstrating measurable business value and outcomes (ie.
increasing revenue or solving operational challenges)
● Problem Solving – expect to be challenged on your solution, be
ready to explain how you think through complex problems and adapt
your solution on the spot
● Prioritization – demonstrate your ability to manage multiple tasks
effectively. During reflection, explain your strategy for balancing
priorities and ensuring strong business outcomes
● Communication — keep your presentation clear and structured.
Ensure both technical and non-technical audiences can easily follow
your ideas
It's completely up to you how you demo this solution (this is not a trick
question).
Again, we are evaluating your technical and solution selling skills so based
on how you have crafted the solution and how you think this audience will
best receive said solution, we are giving you the creative liberty to decide
what's best
